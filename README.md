# Speed Test Project üåê

## Overview
The **Speed Test** project measures the performance of your network connection by sending and receiving  UDP packets. It provides an insight into the quality and reliability of your connection by capturing key metrics like transmission time, data throughput, and packet loss. This tool is useful for diagnosing network issues, evaluating connection stability, and testing overall network speed.

## Features
- **Packet Count**: Displays the number of packets sent during the test.
- **Transmission Time**: Shows how long it took for the packets to be transmitted.
- **Received Data**: Measures the amount of data received during the test.
- **Packet Loss**: Displays the number of lost packets (for UDP).
- **TCP and UDP Protocols**: Allows testing using both TCP and UDP to assess performance under different conditions.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Python**: The core programming language for testing network speed.
- **Socket (TCP/UDP)**: Used to send and receive packets for both protocols.
- **Time**: For calculating the duration of packet transmission.
